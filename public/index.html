          <p>
            After spending a few years doing corprate IT at Comcast, I was able to chnage my career and start as a web developer at Eastern Standard. That was in October 2014.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            At Eastern Standard, I was a full stack developer doing themeing and building of Drupal sites for our clients.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            After moving on from Eastern Standard, I am now doing DevOps at Moven and working on support of developers working on a hybrid mobile app.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            At Eastern Standard, I learned about Node and NPM as our build tools, SASS, along with different Javascript libraries depening on use case.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The best part about the work I do and where I work is being able to use and learn about new technologies to make cool stuff for the web.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Resume will be uploaded shortly.
