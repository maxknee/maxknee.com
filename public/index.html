        <div class='about' id='about'>
          Currently, living in Philadelphia I am a junior web developer at
          <a href='http://www.easternstandard.com'>Eastern Standard</a>
          <br>
          Interested in all things web developement.

          <p>
            After spending a few years doing corprate IT at Comcast, I was able to chnage my career and start as a web developer at Eastern Standard. That was in October 2014.
            At Eastern Standard, I am a full stack developer doing themeing and building of Drupal sites for our clients.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            We take into account interaction, usability, responsive, and accessability for all the sites we build.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            At Eastern Standard, our processes include Node and NPM as our build tools, SASS, along with different Javascript libraries depening on use case.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Since being there, I feel that I have grown a lot as a developer, leveraging my problem solving skills when it comes to building web sites. I am now more comfortable with ES6 and creating modules and function calls. Also never being exposed to PHP and how Drupal really works, I can now build a site with more ease.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The best part about the work I do and where I work is being able to use and leverage new technologies and learn about all the new ideas in web development that are out there.
